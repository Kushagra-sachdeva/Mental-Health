It has the power to make us or break us. Thus it is our responsibility to channelize our mind towards positive thinking. 
Life is a challenge and we need to train ourselves to face the same. Things will not happen as per our wish. We need to prepare ourselves to deal with the challenges we encounter. If we are able to cope up with them we come out to be stronger and better individuals.
The three Cs to manage our lives are commitment, challenge and control. Be committed towards your responsibilities. Accept life as a challenge and have a good control of your own self- your emotions, your thoughts and desires. If you are able to do so, you will be able to sail through the journey of your life with full contentment and happiness.
